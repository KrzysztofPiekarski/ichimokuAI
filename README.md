# 📈 IchimokuAI

**IchimokuAI** is an AI-powered technical analysis system that uses the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo indicator and additional market features to predict buy and sell signals in the Forex market. The project combines the classic approach of chart analysis with modern machine learning methods.

## 🚧 Project Status

 **This project is in active development.**
 
> Currently, work is underway on:

> - feature extraction from market data,

> - integration with AI models (e.g. LSTM, Random Forest),

> - building an interface in Streamlit,

> - testing strategies and validating results.

## 🎯 Main Goals

- 💡 Combining Ichimoku indicator with AI algorithms to generate predictions.
- 📊 Automatic feature extraction from price and volume data.
- 🧠 Training and testing ML models to classify trading signals.
- 🌐 Interactive frontend (Streamlit) for non-technical users.
